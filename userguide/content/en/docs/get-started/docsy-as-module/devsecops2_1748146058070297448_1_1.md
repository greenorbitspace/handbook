## Campaign Overview {#overview}

**In FY23 DevSecOps Campaign has been refreshed and it is part of [the Security & Compliance Lightning Strike](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/3271)**

The purpose of the lightning strike is to generate buzz that creates awareness using a cross-functional GTM plan. The topic of Q3 is security/compliance because a) it drives Ultimate revenue b) is top-of-mind across IT c) continues to face pressure to act now given new regulations.
