<!--
**NB:** Before opening a discussion here, please consider whether it is JS specific, or if it should be considered in the [other OpenTelemetry client libraries](https://github.com/open-telemetry/). If so, please [open an issue on opentelemetry-specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/issues/new) first.
-->

- [ ] This only affects the JavaScript OpenTelemetry library
- [ ] This may affect other libraries, but I would like to get opinions here first
