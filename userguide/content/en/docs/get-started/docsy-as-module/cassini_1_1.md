The Cassini-Huygens mission was a collaboration between NASA, ESA, and ASI to study Saturn and its system. Launched in 1997, it arrived at Saturn in 2004 and operated until 2017. The mission dramatically improved our understanding of Saturn, its rings, and its moons, particularly Titan and Enceladus.
