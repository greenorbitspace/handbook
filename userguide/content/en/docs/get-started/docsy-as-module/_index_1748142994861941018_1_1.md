## How to request access

Simply create an AR https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Individual_Bulk_Access_Request

## How to authenticate

After provisioning us the userâ€™s IPv4 address, we add the IP to the allowlist, then the user will need to download the AWS Workspace client from here:
