Juno is a NASA space probe orbiting Jupiter. It was launched in 2011 and entered Jupiter's orbit in 2016. The spacecraft's mission is to measure Jupiter's composition, gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. Juno has provided new insights into Jupiter's interior structure and the processes that drive its intense magnetic fields and aurorae.
