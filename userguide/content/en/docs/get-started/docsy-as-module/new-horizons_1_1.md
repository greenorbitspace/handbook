New Horizons is an interplanetary space probe launched as part of NASA's New Frontiers program. It performed the first flyby of Pluto in 2015, providing unprecedented data about the dwarf planet. After its Pluto mission, New Horizons continued into the Kuiper Belt, where it encountered the object Arrokoth in 2019, the most distant object in the Solar System visited by a spacecraft.
