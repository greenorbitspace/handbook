## Purpose

A place for support team members to work together on documentation questions, MRs, and issues. SEs can start here for help with:

- Restructuring docs sections
- Collaborating on improvements
- Discussing phrasing, formatting, and content

## Current Objectives

- To make contributing to the docs easy, productive, and maybe even fun.
