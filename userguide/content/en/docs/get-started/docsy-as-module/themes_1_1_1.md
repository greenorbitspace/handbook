This is an informational page for Zendesk themes. It may not reflect the way we actually manage Zendesk themes.

You can severely break a very customer facing item in Zendesk if you do not follow established workflows.

If you are looking for information about managing it, please see [themes workflow](../../workflows/zendesk/themes)

{{% /alert %}}

For information on using themes in Zendesk, please see [Zendesk documentation](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/4405298906266-Using-themes-and-customizing-your-Help-Center).
