## Overview

As part of GitLab's [NFR program policy](/handbook/resellers/channel-working-with-gitlab/#not-for-resale-nfr-program-and-policy), [Channel Partner team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/internal-requests-form/-/issues/10#note_1085735806) will open internal request for NFR license using the internal request form.

As of Feb. 19, 2025, partner NFR licenses will be provisioned as standard cloud licenses instead of as trial subscriptions. Ecosystem Operations manage this process and no longer requires assistance from the support team to provision. Reach out to #global-ecosystem-programs-ops via slack with any questions.
