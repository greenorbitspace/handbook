{{< alert title=Note color=primary >}}

Guide changes are classified as ad-hoc as the changes are made directly in Zendesk. Once changes are made in Zendesk they are live.

Changes to these can cause severe problems if you have not thoroughly tested them. Exercise extreme caution before proceeding.

## Modifying Guide settings

You will make the change directly in Zendesk. Remember any changes should also be reflected in the [Guide documentaiton](../../docs/zendesk/guide) (as it is the single source of truth).
