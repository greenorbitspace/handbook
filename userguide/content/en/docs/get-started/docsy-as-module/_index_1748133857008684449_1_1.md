## Instructions

1. Ask for a Okta unlock (or 2FA reset) in the `#it_help` Slack channel or send an email to `it-help@gitlab.com` and ask for a 2FA Reset.

    > If you do not have access to your work email account, you can send from your personal email address that is on file in Workday.

2. Please be prepared to verify your identity.

3. Once Okta 2FA has been reset, please reconfigure it by signing in to your Okta account and adding a new authenticator using Touch ID or YubiKey.
