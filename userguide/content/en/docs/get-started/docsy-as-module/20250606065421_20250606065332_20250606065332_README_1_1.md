_archive/ â€” Historical and backup storage
Purpose: Store older projects, deprecated tools, experimental code, or backups that are rarely accessed but important to keep.

Naming: Prefix with underscore to keep it at the bottom or out of immediate sight in sorted folder views.

Subfolders: Categorize by purpose to avoid clutter.
