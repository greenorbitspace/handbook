## About Me

More than a decade of work experience in technology, operations and process analysis and implementation. A husband to a very patient wife and a father of two, I still try to find some time play some computer games and watch television series to relax.

### What I do at GitLab

I'm part of the team that handles requests and issues sent through different channels. My tasks include:

- Administration and Configuration
- User Access Provisioning
- Change Deployment
