The kick-off may be handled as part of the [Welcome to GitLab call](/handbook/customer-success/csm/#where-does-a-customer-success-manager-fit-in) orchestrated by the GitLab Customer Success Manager.  However, many times the implementation kick off will be an on-site engagement or one handled directly by the Professional Services Engineer.  This template is for use in those cases.
