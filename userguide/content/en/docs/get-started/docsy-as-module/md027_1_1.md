# `MD027` - Multiple spaces after blockquote symbol

Tags: `blockquote`, `indentation`, `whitespace`

Aliases: `no-multiple-space-blockquote`

Fixable: Some violations can be fixed by tooling

This rule is triggered when blockquotes have more than one space after the
blockquote (`>`) symbol:

```markdown
>  This is a blockquote with bad indentation
>  there should only be one.
```

To fix, remove any extraneous space:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote with correct
> indentation.
```

Rationale: Consistent formatting makes it easier to understand a document.
