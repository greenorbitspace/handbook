Reproducing images of traffic signs
-----------------------------------

Traffic signs are Crown copyright. They are part of legislation (Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002, often referred to as TSRGD).

You may reproduce traffic-sign images free of charge and without having to seek permission, but you must reproduce them accurately and not in a misleading context (eg not on roadside billboards where they could mislead drivers).

You should also include a statement that these images are Crown copyright. Please read the fuller conditions in the Open Government Licence.
